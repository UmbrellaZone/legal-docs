## Third party service providers

Whereever {{company.name}} uses third party service providers to process unencrypted customer data, we make sure to have compliant Data Processing Addendums in place signed by both parties. Thus we ensure safe processing of data throughout our infrastructure without loosing control. Any data that we don't need to comply with European or German law will be deleted whenever it is not needed anymore.
